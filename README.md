# Watermark App

## Overview

The Watermark App is a simple GUI tool designed to allow users to add watermarks to their images. Developed using the `tkinter` library and the Python Imaging Library (PIL), this application provides an easy-to-use interface for uploading an image and embedding a custom text watermark.

## Features

- **Image Upload:** Users can easily upload images from their local storage.
- **Custom Watermark:** Users can add custom text as a watermark to their uploaded image.
- **Edit Watermark:** Users can edit the text of an existing watermark.
- **Remove Watermark:** Users can remove the watermark and restore the original image.
- **Save Image:** Users can save the modified image with the watermark.
- **Rotate Image:** Users can rotate the uploaded image by 90 degrees.
- **Preview:** A canvas is available to display and preview the image with the watermark.
